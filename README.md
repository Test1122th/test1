# DEGAN

This is the code repository for **DEGAN** (**D**ensity **E**stimation **G**enerative **A**dversarial **N**etwork).

Users of this repo can conduct training and configuring Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) through the DEGAN framework for detecting anomalies on new time series. 


## Description
**DEGAN** is an unsupervised Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based anomaly detection framework. 

### Framework  

The framework contains three main components: GAN training, _**D**_ model selection, and anomaly detection. It makes use of the information contained in normal time series (processed using a sliding window method) during GAN training and _**D**_ model selection, enabling a validated _**D**_ model to be an independent anomaly detector after training for a given system. 

In the anomaly detection component, kernel density estimation is used to assign a probability distribution to the suspicious data points identified by the selected _**D**_ model and identify the areas with the highest probability of being anomalies.

### Time Series

The DEGAN framework centers around repeated time series acquired to monitor the temporal variation in the operation of a given system. These time series reflect the performance of the system and the goal is to identify when/where an anomalous event is observed. 

The example below shows an overall process of using repeated time series data for training, validation and testing in DEGAN, where _TSA_ is training data, _TSB_ is validation data and _TSC_ is testing data.

## Register Simulation Environments
We demonstrate Gnu-RL in an EnergyPlus model. Check [here](Demo.ipynb) for details.

To set up the co-simulation environment with EnergyPlus: 
- Read the documentation of [Gym-Eplus](https://github.com/zhangzhizza/Gym-Eplus) on registering simulation environments. 
- All the EnergyPlus model files used in the demo are placed under ./eplus_env.
- Register the environments following this table. A  *\_\_init\_\_.py* file for registration is included. Place it under *Gym-Eplus/eplus_env/*. 
- Place the model and weather files under *Gym-Eplus/eplus_env/envs/* at the corresponding location.  
- Check that the placement of model files and weather files match *\_\_init\_\_.py*.
- Finally, change line 24 in *Gym-Eplus/eplus_env/envs/eplus8_6.py* to
